# It serves as three functions

>1. Deploy any object detection trained model
>2. Create ground-truth data by drawing bounding boxes
>3. Automatically continual learning when new data hit certain threshold.

# Usage
1. upload an iamge, the object will be drew a bounding box (you could use other trained algorithm to realize other objec detection)
